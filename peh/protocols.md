# Protocols ...

**What are protocols?**
> Protocols are rules for computers when they need to communicate
> with each other. The rules are brought into action so that
> different types of hardware can talk to each other regardless
> of their underlying architecture.

## OSI Model:

> The OSI model is a standard model which is typically used for
> designing protocols and is also a great representation of how a
> network works.

**Here the 7-Layers Of OSI Model:**
