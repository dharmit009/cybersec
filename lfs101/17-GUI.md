# Graphical User Interface:

You can use either a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) when using Linux. To work at the CLI, you have to remember which programs and commands are used to perform tasks, and how to quickly and accurately obtain more information about their use and options. On the other hand, using the GUI is often quick and easy. It allows you to interact with your system through graphical icons and screens. For repetitive tasks, the CLI is often more efficient, while the GUI is easier to navigate if you do not remember all the details or do something only rarely.

## X Window System:

Loading the graphical desktop is one of the final steps in the boot process of a Linux desktop. Historically, this was known as the **X Windows System**, often just called `X`.

A service called the Display Manager keeps track of the displays being provided and loads the X server (so-called, because it provides graphical services to applications, sometimes called X clients). The display manager also handles graphical logins and starts the appropriate desktop environment after a user logs in.

X is rather old software; it dates back to the mid-1980s and, as such, has certain deficiencies on modern systems (for example, with security), as it has been stretched rather far from its original purposes. A newer system, known as Wayland, is gradually superseding it and is the default display system for Fedora, RHEL, and other recent distributions.  For the most part, it looks just like X to the user, although under the hood it is quite different.

If the display manager is not started by default in the default runlevel, you can start the graphical desktop different way, after logging on to a text-mode console, by running startx from the command line. Or, you can start the display manager (gdm, kdm, xdm, etc.) manually from the command line. This differs from running startx as the display managers will project a sign in screen.

## GUI Startup Process:

When you install a desktop environment, the display manager starts at the end of the boot process. It is responsible for starting the graphics system, logging in the user, and starting the userâ€™s desktop environment. You can often select from a choice of desktop environments when logging in to the system.

The default display manager for GNOME is called *gdm*. Another popular display manager is *kdm*, associated with KDE.
