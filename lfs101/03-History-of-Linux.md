# History Of Linux:

**Linus Torvalds** was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system kernel. He also collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center. It wasn't long before this became known as the Linux kernel.

In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the General Public License (GPL) by GNU (a project of the Free Software Foundation or FSF, which promotes freely available software), which enabled it to build a worldwide community of developers. By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called Linux Distributions, which first appeared in the mid-90s.
