# Way Of Thinking:

You don't need to learn everything you just need to learn a few basic
concepts/principles first in order to get good at it.

1. The Principle Of Abstraction.
1. The Principle Of Correspondence.
1. The Principle Of Data Type Completeness.

Don't always try to find the easiest method for solving problems look
for other things as well as it will improve your overall skills and make
you more proficient in the field. Look for as many ways as you can
tackle the problem.

Think Outside the box... If there are no limitations go ahead and flex
your skills to solve the problem.

**Why Didn't I Thought Out of the box?**

I restricted myself to the given information and assume that I have to
play with the given data itself. Another reason was I didn't gave it a
try thought it would waste my time which was not true. I should have
given it a try at least.

**Have a Goal in Your Mind.**
