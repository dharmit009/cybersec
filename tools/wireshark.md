[Wireshark][1] is a network protocol analyzer through which you can
interactively capture, browse packet data of a live network or a
previously saved capture file. All the capture files are saved with
`.pcap` extension.


**Basics of Wireshark:**

Let us first start with understanding the basic interface of
[**Wireshark**](1). To list all the interfaces it is necessary to use
`root` privileges (i.e `sudo` privileges).

**Note:** Only use `root` account if you know what you are actually
doing or performing.
